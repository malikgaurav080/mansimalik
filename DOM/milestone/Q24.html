      This is a sample paragraph with some words longer than eight characters.
      As your newly-elected Supreme Leader, I’m delighted to put to bed those
      wicked rumours from my traiterous, lying opponents. I was always innocent,
      as 99.99% of you, the people, have demonstrated in a free and fair
      election. My first act in government is to delete Fridays. Everyone will
      appreciate working a shorter week – nobody bothered on Fridays, anyway –
      and six-day weeks mean each birthday will come around every 312 days
      rather than 365. More birthdays will generate more celebration activity,
      and boost the economy. Best of all, we’ll all live 11% more years. All
      except those who disagree, who won’t.
